{"Market manipulation": {"case_studies": ["One example of SEBI taking action against a company for market manipulation violations is the case of Videocon International Limited vs. SEBI [23-26/2001].\n\nIn this case, SEBI carried out an investigation into the alleged price manipulation in the shares of certain companies, including Videocon International Limited. The investigation revealed that a set of brokers and sub-brokers acting in concert and on behalf of a common set of clients cornered a large chunk of shares of Videocon International Limited at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) and thereby \"built up unusually large positions\" in the company's shares.\n\nBased on the findings of the investigation, SEBI issued show-cause notices to the company and its directors, asking them to explain their conduct in the context of the prima facie finding that the company had indulged in violating regulation 4(a) and 4(d) of the 1995 Regulations. The company and its directors answered the show-cause notices, and the matter was adjudicated by the Chairman of SEBI.\n\nThe impugned order confirmed the charges against Videocon International Limited, holding it guilty of violating regulation 4(a) and 4(d) of the 1995 Regulations. The order also directed the company not to raise money from the public in the capital market for a period of three years and launched prosecution proceedings against the company and its directors under the SEBI Act, 1992.\n\nThis case is an example of SEBI taking action against a company for market manipulation violations, which is a serious offense under Indian securities laws.", "One example of SEBI taking action against a company for market manipulation violations is the case of BPL Limited vs. SEBI [14-19 of 2001] [Final order].\n\nIn this case, SEBI investigated BPL Limited and its directors/officers for alleged market manipulation in the company's shares. The investigation found that the company had engaged in a \"pump and dump\" scheme, where it artificially boosted the price of its shares through false and misleading statements, and then sold its positions after the price had increased.\n\nSEBI issued a show cause notice to BPL Limited and its directors/officers, asking them to explain their conduct. The company and its officials responded to the notice, but SEBI found that they had indulged in market manipulation and violated regulations 4(a) and 4(d) of the 1995 Regulations.\n\nAs a result, SEBI imposed penalties on BPL Limited, including a ban on the company from raising money from the public in the capital market for a period of three years. Additionally, SEBI launched prosecution proceedings against the company and its directors/officers under the SEBI Act, 1992.\n\nThis case is a landmark example of SEBI's efforts to protect investors and promote fair and transparent market practices in India. It demonstrates the regulatory body's commitment to taking action against companies and individuals who engage in market manipulation and other fraudulent activities.", "One example of SEBI taking action against a company for market manipulation violations is the case of Adani Enterprises Limited. In 2007, SEBI filed a criminal complaint against Adani Enterprises Limited, its promoters, and certain other promoter group entities for violating various provisions of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SCRA) and certain notifications issued by SEBI. The complaint alleged that the company and its promoters had aided and abetted entities associated with Ketan Parekh in manipulating the price of the equity shares of Adani Enterprises Limited.\n\nAs a result of the complaint, SEBI issued a show cause notice to certain entities forming part of the promoter group, prohibiting them from accessing the securities market directly or indirectly and from buying, selling, or otherwise dealing in securities for a period of two years. The company and its promoters also filed consent applications, which were compounded by the court, resulting in a fine of \u20b93.00 million.\n\nThis case is an example of SEBI's efforts to prevent and punish market manipulation, which is a serious violation of securities laws and regulations. Market manipulation can have serious consequences for investors, including loss of confidence in the market and damage to the reputation of companies and individuals involved."], "link_text":

September 2023 Gautam Shantilal Adani founder and chairman of the Adani Group Photo Wikimedia  License  By OCCRP Twitter Indian political leaders intellectuals and activists called on Friday for the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the findings of an OCCRP investigation hours after its publication In partnership with the Guardian and the Financial Times OCCRP had revealed that foreign associates of the Adanis a wealthy Indian family closely connected to Prime Minister Narendra Modi secretly held large stakes in the familys business empire in possible violation of the countrys law Indian National Congress leader Rahul Gandhi one of Modis main political rivals said at a press conference on Thursday that at the very least a Joint Parliamentary Committee should be formed to investigate why the two foreigners were allowed to manipulate the valuation of a company that controls almost all of Indias infrastructure Why is there no investigation taking place he asked Sanjay Singh a member of the Indian parliaments upper house from the opposition Aam Aadmi Party AAP held a press conference with his colleague Reena Gupta the partys national spokesperson The two also highlighted the findings of the investigation and Singh said he would write to the Enforcement Directorate an Indian agency responsible for investigating financial crimes as well as to SEBI the countrys stock market regulator Mahua Moitra a politician from the All India Trinamool Congress an opposition party primarily influential in Bengal tagged the official account of SEBI urging the agency to do your job Months before OCCRPs investigation was published the New Yorkbased shortseller Hindenberg caused a political and economic storm in India when it leveled serious charges of stock manipulation against the Adani Group a powerful conglomerate with an extraordinary range of interests in various industries from TV stations to airports One of the most crucial aspects of Hindenbergs allegations was the claim that many of the groups ostensibly public investors were actually closely associated with the conglomerate possibly violating Indian securities laws The accusations led to protests and caused Adani Group stocks to plummet Indias Supreme Court convened an expert committee to look into the matter but the investigation was inconclusive because the government agencies it contacted couldnt verify the identities of the suspicious investors due to convoluted offshore structures In OCCRPs investigation files from multiple tax havens bank records and internal Adani Group emails allowed reporters to identify two of the investors as Naseer Ali Shaban Ahli from the United Arab Emirates and Chang ChungLing from Taiwan OCCRPs investigation was published in collaboration with The Guardian and the Financial Times The two men invested hundreds of millions of dollars in publicly traded Adani stock through opaque investment funds based in the island nation of Mauritius These investments also appear to have been coordinated with an Adani company Ahli and Changs trading in Adani Group stock is significant because both men are widely known to be closely linked to the Adani family including appearing as shareholders and directors in affiliated companies Indian law forbids insiders from owning more than 75 percent of a publicly listed company  a limit that their actions may have breached OCCRP reporters also obtained a letter that the Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI the Indian regulator received from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence DRI Indias premier investigative agency under the Ministry of Finance in 2014 In the letter the DRI noted that it had evidence that money from an alleged overinvoicing scheme perpetrated by Adani it was investigating had been sent to Mauritius  and was invested in Adani stock The Indian market is ripe for stock manipulation What you claim to have found is a broader indictment of the system Professor Aswath Damodaran who teaches corporate finance and valuation at the Stern School of Business at New York University told OCCRP on Friday Damodaran blamed SEBI arguing that the regulator should have taken action back then The SEBI are the actual culprits The victim here is the longterm trust in the market he said Damodaran explained that the Adani Group is the most highlypriced infrastructure company in the world and many of its actions including its spinoffs have no discernible economic rationale The veteran journalist N Ram asked on X formerly known as Twitter whether Indias SEBI  the Enforcement Directorate will take cognizance of these investigative reports and investigate the fresh allegations Or will there be an attempted coverup which is likely to fail And will this new information come up before the Supreme Court of India which is hearing the AdaniHindenburg case On Thursday the Adani Group reiterated the denials it had already issued to OCCRP reporters in response to the allegations However its stocks fell into the red minutes after stock markets opened in India India gautam adani nerenda modi Contact Privacy Policy Bypassing Censorship About Member Centers

against two separate groups of foreign portfolio investors The group facing market manipulation allegations are suspected to have shorted stocks in firms led by billionaire Gautam Adani Bloomberg Last Updated  24 April 2024 0308 IST Last Updated  24 April 2024 0308 IST Follow Us  Comments By Saikat Das Indias capital markets regulator has asked a clutch of global funds to defend themselves against allegations of improper disclosures and market manipulation relating to trading of Adani Group stocks according to people familiar with the matter The Securities and Exchange Board of India or Sebi has taken this action against two separate groups of foreign portfolio investors The group facing market manipulation allegations are suspected to have shorted stocks in firms led by billionaire Gautam Adani after getting wind that a short seller report would be published soon the people said asking not to be identified as the details are not public The people did not name the funds The short seller report in question from USbased Hindenburg Research sliced off over 100 billion in market value for the Adani Group soon after it was published in January 2023 The second group to receive Sebis so called showcause notices are overseas funds that Hindenburg alleged were linked to the Adani Groups founders Sebi is seeking an explanation from these funds as it looks into possible violation of disclosure norms the people said The conglomerate has repeatedly denied any links to the funds which faced intense scrutiny in June 2021 for investing almost all of their assets in Adani stocks A representative for Sebi didnt immediately respond to a request for comment A spokesperson for the Adani Group did not offer any comment The regulator will issue a final order in these probes which could take a few months or more after hearing the funds explanations Draw a Line Sebis findings in these two longstanding probes will draw a line under the Hindenburg episode at least domestically Indias top court said in January that there would be no more probes in this saga after the regulator closes its investigation The Indian markets regulator has accused the funds of failing to maintain and disclose information about their ultimate beneficial owners as well as for breaching investment limits in listed entities of Adani Group during certain periods according to a report Monday in The Economic Times  The legal representatives of eight investors in this group of investors  Albula Investment Fund Cresta Fund MGC Fund Asia Investment Corporation Mauritius APMS Investment Fund Elara India Opportunities Fund Vespera Fund and LTS Investment Fund  are looking to settle with Sebi by paying fines without admission of guilt the media report said The Sebi probe was expanded at the Supreme Courts behest to include market manipulation after Hindenburg accused the Adani Group of fraudulently pumping up its stock prices through a web of undisclosed overseas funds The conglomerate has denied Hindenburgs allegations The Adani Groups stocks have been on a rollercoaster ride in the past few years Some of its firms saw stock gains of more than 1000 per cent between 2020 and early2023 leaving them valued at priceearnings ratios much higher than peer companies and fueling speculation over which investors were bidding them up Then came the epic rout triggered by Hindenburgs report sending shares plunging Adanis bonds and stocks mostly recovered since and the group is back to making investments and raising funds ADVERTISEMENT Published 24 April 2024 0308 IST Business News

decide the nature of action to be taken Premium Sebi launched the probe after the redemption crisis faced by JP Morgan India Treasury Fund and JP Morgan India Short Term Income Fund in August 2015 Photo Aniruddha ChowdhuryMint Read Full Story Mumbai Indias capital market watchdog is likely to act against two rating companies following an investigation of ratings assigned to debt securities of troubled auto parts maker Amtek Auto Ltd and a subsequent redemption crisis at JP Morgan Asset Management Co said two people familiar with the matter The action would mark the first time the Securities and Exchange Board of India Sebi takes rating companies to task Sebi is in the final stages of its investigation said the two people cited above on condition of anonymity The regulator will decide the nature of action to be taken once the investigation is complete The investigation is against rating agencies Credit Analysis and Research Ltd CARE Ratings and Crisil Ltd in the matter of rating Amtek Autos debt paper and rating JP Morgans corporate debt fund said one of the two persons Sebi launched the probe after the redemption crisis faced by JP Morgan India Treasury Fund and JP Morgan India Short Term Income Fund in August 2015 The crisis was brought on by a sharp downgrade and withdrawal of ratings on bonds of Amtek Auto which was on the verge of defaulting on  800 crore in bond repayments The crisis drew attention to the conduct of the rating agencies in assigning a credit rating to the Amtek Auto bonds and the JP Morgan schemes CARE Ratings chose to suspend its rating on Amtek Auto on 7 August 2015 The agency had given Amtek Auto an AA rating AA signifies a high degree of safety regarding timely servicing of financial obligations Such instruments carry very low credit risk The minus with the rating signifies a low standing within the category As per Sebi regulations a credit assessor cannot suspend its rating on an outstanding debt security A rating can be suspended only if the security is clubbed with another security or in the case of a company merging with another one Suspension of rating is a violation as per Sebi regulations Even if a company is not disclosing relevant information pertinent to the rating an agency is required to assign a rating based on available information with a caveat that there is lack of information The regulator is looking into that aspect said the second person cited above In response to an email CARE Ratings said it had not received any communication from Sebi on the investigation or on possible action Credit rating is assigned to any instrument based on data that is publicly available as well as detailed discussions with the company The latter is a crucial part of the rating process to better understand the past financials current trends and projections on which the future debt servicing capability hinges on said a spokesperson for CARE Ratings Suspension becomes unavoidable at times as we may not be in a position to take a call on the credit profile of the company in the absence of cooperation from the companys end You may note that the policy of ratings suspension is a market practice and is also done by other rating agencies too the spokesperson added Crisil Ltd had assigned a rating of AAAmfs signifying the highest portfolio credit quality to the JP Morgan India Treasury Scheme in May 2015 A rating is based on the ratings of debt securities held in the portfolio of the scheme Subsequently Crisil revised the rating for the scheme in three stages over two months On 1 September it downgraded the scheme from AAAmfs to Amfs On 29 September the scheme was downgraded to BBBmfs which meant an eight notch downgrade within a month Finally on 15 October Crisil placed the scheme on notice of withdrawal Given the sequence of eventsSebi is examining whether the agency failed in its fiduciary responsibility by not issuing a timely warning to investors A Crisil spokesperson in an emailed response said it hadnt received any communication from Sebi on the probe While Sebi is investigating individual agencies it is also in the process of tightening rules and disclosure norms for rating agencies in general In January Mint reported that Sebi is likely to ask rating agencies to set up independent internal assessment teams which will be required to determine whether the rating assigned to a company is appropriate or not This will be over and above the team which assigns the initial rating Sebi may also ask rating agencies to give clear reasons if they choose to withdraw their rating on a company Tougher norms for rating agencies have become necessary in the light of recent developments Apart from the Amtek Auto episode there have been other cases where sharp and sudden downgrades have left investors in the lurch On 15 February Crisil downgraded Jindal Steel and Power Ltds debt rating to BBA4 from BBBA3 On 9 March it cut the rating further to D The downgrades hit funds such as Franklin Templeton Asset Management India Pvt Ltd which held these securities Another recent example has been the case of Ricoh India Ltd While the case was one of suspected fraud it highlighted the inability of a credit assessor to act as an early warning system for investors Ricoh India saw its revenues and liabilities jump sharply between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2015 without any corresponding increase in fixed assets or profits The company also delayed declaring its September 2015 quarter earnings until last month ALSO READ The curious case of Ricoh Indias balance sheet Despite this India Ratings and Research Pvt Ltd in January 2016 upgraded the companys nonconvertible debentures In March it put the company on Negative Watch but did not downgrade the securities India Ratings explained this by saying that its ratings were largely reflecting the operational linkages and financial support from Ricoh Japan This is clearly a first that a regulator is looking at the action of the rating agencies There has been enough noise made on the nonperforming asset levels of banks but rating agency actions have so far not been examined said Amit Tandon founder and managing director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services a proxy advisory firm With Sebi examining the role of rating agencies it will be a signal to the market that the creditrating firms will be held accountable for their actions he added According to Tandon the regulation barring creditors from suspending the rating on debt securities requires a relook Suspension of rating has become a market practice as it is a viable option when relevant data is not available The regulator must factor in that suspension of ratings is an option and relook at the regulations accordingly added Tandon
